## The Question
What are the implications of using .hacs (Hash-Addressed Content System), .cdis (Content-Defined Intelligent Segmentation), or a hybrid approach for Orkestra's file compression and deduplication? Consider: 1) The democracy engine with voting, ethical foundation, and cryptographic hashing; 2) The committee system with agent configs and question workflows; 3) The project structure with 5 AI agents (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Copilot); 4) Performance vs complexity trade-offs; 5) Implementation effort and maintenance burden; 6) Integration with existing task queues, logs, and archives.
