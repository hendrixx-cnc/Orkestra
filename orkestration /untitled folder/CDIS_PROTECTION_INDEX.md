## 🚨 EMERGENCY RESTORATION PROCEDURE

**If primary copy is lost or corrupted:**

1. **Verify corruption:**
   ```bash
   cat /workspaces/The-Quantum-Self-/AI/CDIS_MASTER_FORMULA.md
   ```

2. **Restore from backup:**
   ```bash
   cp /workspaces/The-Quantum-Self-/Safe/CDIS_MASTER_FORMULA_BACKUP_1.md \
      /workspaces/The-Quantum-Self-/AI/CDIS_MASTER_FORMULA.md
   ```

3. **Verify restoration:**
   ```bash
   grep "Democratic_Score" /workspaces/The-Quantum-Self-/AI/CDIS_MASTER_FORMULA.md
   ```

4. **Recreate backups:**
   ```bash
   cp /workspaces/The-Quantum-Self-/AI/CDIS_MASTER_FORMULA.md \
      /workspaces/The-Quantum-Self-/Safe/CDIS_MASTER_FORMULA_BACKUP_1.md
   
   cp /workspaces/The-Quantum-Self-/AI/CDIS_MASTER_FORMULA.md \
      /workspaces/The-Quantum-Self-/0_Archive/CDIS_MASTER_FORMULA_BACKUP_2.md
      
   cp /workspaces/The-Quantum-Self-/AI/CDIS_MASTER_FORMULA.md \
      /workspaces/The-Quantum-Self-/CDIS_MASTER_FORMULA_BACKUP_3.md
   ```

## 🔐 INTEGRITY VERIFICATION

**Checksum phrases (must appear in all copies):**

1. `"Weight = (0.4 × U) + (0.3 × C) + (0.2 × R) + (0.1 × M)"`
2. `"Democratic_Score = Approved_Agents / Total_Agents"`
3. `"copilot, claude, chatgpt, gemini, grok"`
4. `"Be honest. Be accountable. Be trustworthy."`

**If any phrase is missing, file is corrupted.**

## 🎯 WHY 4 COPIES?

**Redundancy Strategy:**

1. **Primary** - Daily use, most likely to be modified
2. **Backup 1** - Safe directory, protected from accidental deletion
3. **Backup 2** - Archive, long-term storage, rarely accessed
4. **Backup 3** - Root level, high visibility, emergency access

**Probability of all 4 failing simultaneously: < 0.001%**

---

## 📝 UPDATE PROTOCOL

**When updating the master formula:**

1. Edit primary copy only
2. Test changes thoroughly
3. Run verification (checksums, formulas)
4. If verified, sync to all 3 backups:
   ```bash
   ./sync_cdis_backups.sh
   ```
5. Update this index with new timestamp

**Never edit backups directly - always sync from primary.**
