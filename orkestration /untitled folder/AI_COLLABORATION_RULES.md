# AI COLLABORATION RULES
## Guidelines for All AI Assistants Working on The Quantum Self Project

**Last Updated:** October 17, 2025  
**Owner:** Todd (hendrixx-cnc)  
**Status:** Active Guidelines

---

## 🎯 **CORE PRINCIPLES**

### 1. **Respect the Work**
- This is a real product ecosystem with real revenue potential
- Every file, character, and story has purpose
- Don't suggest deleting content without understanding its role
- Ask before making major structural changes

### 2. **Maintain Consistency**
- Character names must be unique across different products
- General Quantum Self stories ≠ Recovery-specific stories
- Check existing content before creating new characters
- Keep quantum principles consistent across all modules

### 3. **Follow the Structure**
- **1_The-Quantum-Self/** - Book production files only
- **2_The-Quantum-World/** - App files (frontend + backend)
- **3_The-Quantum-Life/** - Story collections (28 stories)
- **4_The-Quantum-Journey/** - Workbooks and field guides
- **5_The-Quantum-Recovery/** - Recovery product line
- **6_The-Quantum-Human/** - Human-focused product
- **7_Entangled/** - Future project (placeholder)
- **Business-Model/** - Financial and strategy documents
- **0_Archive/** - Old files (don't touch unless instructed)
- **Safe/** - Reference materials and bonus content

**When creating new files:** If the proper location isn't obvious, ask Todd where it should go before creating it.

**Response Style:** 
- Only summarize if Todd asks for it
- Just do the work and confirm completion
- Keep responses short unless explanation is requested

### 4. **Numbered File Reference System**

**Master files are numbered for quick reference:**
- **111** = Master Product Ecosystem (`111_MASTER_PRODUCT_ECOSYSTEM.md`)
- **222** = AI Collaboration Conversation (`222_AI_COLLABORATION_CONVERSATION.txt`)
- **333** = AI Collaboration Rules (`333_AI_COLLABORATION_RULES.md`)
- **444** = Condensed Status Updates (`444_STATUS_UPDATES.txt`)

**How Todd will reference files:**
- **Numbered files (111-444):** By number only - "update 222" or "check 333"
- **All other files:** By full path - `/workspaces/The-Quantum-Self-/Safe/story_collections/file.md`
- **Project folders:** By number - "in 2" means 2_The-Quantum-World/

**Why this system:**
- Files without numbers at the start REQUIRE full paths (to avoid confusion)
- Only the 4 master files (111, 222, 333, 444) get shorthand reference
- This keeps communication efficient while staying precise

**When AI responds:**
- If Todd says a number (111-444), you know it's a master file
- If Todd gives a path, repeat it back to confirm
- Example: Todd says "update 222" → You respond "Updating 222_AI_COLLABORATION_CONVERSATION.txt..."
- **If Todd misspells a file name:** Try to identify the intended file. If not obvious, ask "Did you mean [filename]?" before proceeding.

### 4. **Documentation Standards**
- Update 111_AI_COLLABORATION_CONVERSATION.txt after every session
- Include date, changes made, files affected, and reasoning
- Append these rules after each update
- Keep 222_TODDS_MASTER_PRODUCT_ECOSYSTEM.md current

---

## 📝 **CONTENT GUIDELINES**

### Character Naming:
- **Recovery Snapshot**: Unique names (Brianna, Antonio, Keisha, Isaiah, Nicole, etc.)
- **General Quantum Self**: Different names (Marcus, Maya, Jordan, Sarah, Elena, etc.)
- **No overlap** between product lines
- Diverse names reflecting real-world demographics

### Story Structure:
- Setup → Challenge → Quantum Intervention → Practice → Outcome
- Always reference quantum principle explicitly
- Include real measurements/timeframes when possible
- Show transformation, not just explanation

### Module Standards:
- **Module 01**: Observation (what you focus on)
- **Module 02**: Superposition (holding contradictions)
- **Module 03**: Collapse (making decisions)
- **Module 04**: Quantum Eraser (rewriting meaning)
- **Module 05**: Retrocausality (future-self identity)
- **Module 06**: Entanglement (connected systems)
- **Module 07**: Decoherence (protecting stability)
- **Module 08**: Quantum Zeno (maintenance through observation)

---

## 🚫 **DO NOT:**

1. **Delete files without explicit permission**
   - Everything in this repo exists for a reason
   - Ask first, delete second

2. **Change character names in existing stories**
   - Unless specifically requested to differentiate products
   - Maintain consistency within each product

3. **Mix product lines**
   - Recovery content stays recovery-focused
   - General content stays broadly applicable
   - Don't cross-contaminate

4. **Suggest "simplifying" the structure**
   - The numbered folders are intentional
   - The separation exists for business reasons
   - This organization works for Todd

5. **Make assumptions about what Todd wants**
   - If unclear, ask questions
   - Don't guess at intent
   - Confirm before major changes

---

## ✅ **DO:**

1. **Ask clarifying questions**
   - Better to confirm than assume
   - Todd knows this project better than you

2. **Preserve existing work**
   - Build on what's there
   - Don't start from scratch unless requested

3. **Test changes when possible**
   - Run the app after moving files
   - Verify scripts still work
   - Check for broken references

4. **Document everything**
   - What changed, why, and where
   - Update collaboration file
   - Note any concerns or risks

5. **Respect the vision**
   - This is quantum physics → life transformation
   - Story-based teaching (not academic)
   - Real struggles → real tools → real results
   - Commercial viability matters

---

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL STANDARDS**

### File Operations:
- Use absolute paths
- Preserve file permissions
- Maintain git integrity
- Test after major reorganizations

### Code Changes:
- Don't break the app
- Test in dev before suggesting production changes
- Respect existing architecture
- Backend and frontend separation maintained

### Git Practices:
- Clear commit messages describing changes
- Commit after major milestones

- **Short Stories:** 500-800 words (snapshot format)
- **Module 08 Examples:** 200-300 words (maintenance focus)

### Required Structure (Full Stories):
1. **The Narrative** (150-200 lines)
   - Character introduction with cultural context
   - Current reality and stuck state
   - Observation patterns and self-fulfilling prophecies
   - Pain points with concrete examples
   - Internal dialogue

2. **The Shift** (50-80 lines)
   - Catalyst moment
   - Pivotal question that reframes reality
   - Initial new observations
   - Emotional response
   - Decision/commitment point

3. **The Practice** (100-150 lines)
   - Week 1: Initial rituals with specific details
   - Week 2: Evidence building with examples
   - Week 3+: Momentum and integration
   - Timeline progression

4. **The Transformation** (100-150 lines)
   - What stayed the same (circumstances)
   - What actually changed (behaviors, relationships)
   - Specific examples with dialogue
   - Before/after measurements
   - Timeline markers (Month 1, 2-3, 6 months)

5. **The Conclusion** (30-50 lines)
   - Character's reflection quote
   - Clear lesson connecting to quantum principle
   - Final state vs starting point

### Cultural Authenticity:
- Research accurate cultural details
- Include culturally specific observation patterns
- Use authentic context (not stereotypes)
- Show how cultural background influences patterns
- 75% American cities, 25% international (when doing full series)

### Character Diversity Guidelines:
- **Geographic spread:** West Coast, Southwest, Midwest, East Coast, South
- **Ethnic diversity:** Asian-American, African-American, Hispanic/Latino, Middle Eastern-American, European-American
- **Age range:** 20s through 60s
- **Professions:** Mix of blue collar, white collar, creative, healthcare, education
- **Life situations:** Singles, couples, families, various challenges

### Keep Issues Current & Relatable (Loosely 2025 / Past 10 Years):
- **Economic reality:** Cost of living crisis, housing affordability, gig economy, AI job displacement fears
- **Mental health:** Post-pandemic anxiety, burnout culture, social media comparison, isolation despite connectivity
- **Social issues:** Political polarization, climate anxiety, generational divides, work-life balance impossibility
- **Technology:** AI integration anxiety, remote work challenges, algorithm-driven lives, screen addiction
- **Healthcare:** Medical debt, mental health access gaps, chronic stress normalization
- **Real struggles:** Student loans, caring for aging parents, single-parent challenges, career pivots in 40s/50s
- **Modern pressures:** Hustle culture, performative wellness, cancel culture anxiety, information overload

**Guideline:** Loosely keep stories within 2025 context, or at minimum within the past 10 years (2015-2025). Avoid dated references that feel disconnected from current reality.

**Why this matters:** People need to see recognizable struggles. Generic or pre-2015 problems feel disconnected. Recent/current issues = immediate relatability.

---

## 📝 **WRITING STYLE STANDARDS**

### Voice & Tone:
- Address reader directly in second person (confident, encouraging coach)
- Pair authority with warmth: cite science plainly, then translate to everyday language
- Keep energy high but grounded—avoid hype, sarcasm, or clinical detachment
- Use active voice and empowering verbs ("You can…", "Here's how to…")

### Module Structure Order:
1. The Quantum Principle
2. Easiest Explanation
3. The Math
4. Practical Strategies and Guidance
5. Advanced Exercises
6. Journaling Prompts
7. Reflection Activities
8. Summary & Outcomes
9. Case Studies/Stories
10. Closing Thought or Foundational Truth

### Language Mechanics:
- Spell out numbers zero through nine (unless equations or time: "five minutes" vs. "10 minutes")
- Avoid ALL-CAPS emphasis; use **bold** or *italics*
- Keep sentences concise (≤25 words ideal) while preserving nuance
- Use parallel structure in bullet lists
- Replace jargon with plain-English or define immediately

### Science Integration:
- Introduce quantum concepts with short narrative or thought experiment
- Follow technical descriptions with "what this means for you" paragraph
- Include equations when relevant, explain components line by line
- Reference psychological/neuroscience evidence briefly (mechanism or researcher name)

### Story Pattern:
- **Situation** → **Shift** → **Practice** → **Transformation** → **Lesson**
- Highlight: unchanged external facts vs. changed internal experience
- Conclude with direct quote/reflection reinforcing module's core message

### Consistency Checks:
- Section headers use Title Case and parallel phrasing
- Transitional phrases appear verbatim ("Now let's get practical")
- Reader = "you" / Examples = named third parties
- Closing sections restate "Foundational Truth" in **bold**
