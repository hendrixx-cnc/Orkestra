## 📖 Story Structure Requirements

### Each Character Gets 7 Stories (One Per Module):

1. **Module 01 - Observation:** Character notices patterns in their life
2. **Module 02 - Superposition:** Character holds multiple possibilities simultaneously
3. **Module 03 - Wave Function Collapse:** Character makes a defining choice
4. **Module 04 - Quantum Eraser:** Character rewrites past narratives
5. **Module 05 - Retrocausality:** Future self/goals guide present actions
6. **Module 06 - Entanglement:** Character navigates relationships/influence
7. **Module 07 - Decoherence:** Character maintains authenticity under pressure

### Length & Style:
- **400-500 words per story** (can go longer if story demands it)
- **8th grade reading level**
- **Realistic, grounded scenarios** - no fantasy, no heavy-handed metaphors
- **Show don't tell** - let readers discover the quantum principle through the story
- **Emotional authenticity** - real human struggles, not inspirational posters

---

## ❌ Patterns to Avoid (From STORY_GENERATION_MEMORY.md)

1. **No "suddenly" or "all at once" moments** - Change is gradual
2. **No cliché phrases** - Avoid: "took a deep breath," "heart racing," "little did she know"
3. **No explaining the metaphor** - Don't say "like quantum observation" - just show it
4. **No perfect endings** - Keep it real, messy, ongoing
5. **No inspirational poster language** - Grounded dialogue only
6. **No protagonist narrating their own insights** - Show through action/dialogue
7. **No therapy-speak** - Real people don't talk like therapists

---

## ✨ What Works Well (From Maya's Arc)

1. **Specific sensory details** - "kitchen table office," "sad desk salad," "5:47 AM"
2. **Internal/external split** - Observer self watching performing self
3. **Realistic dialogue** - "Can I think about it?" vs grand speeches
4. **Quiet moments of clarity** - Not lightning bolts, just... knowing
5. **Consequences shown** - "40% revenue drop," "anxiety spiked"
6. **Physical reactions** - "shoulders dropped," "jaw unclenched"
7. **Real-world stakes** - Health insurance, retirement, money fears

## 💡 Tips for Each Module

### Module 01 (Observation):
- Character notices something they've been ignoring
- Split between observer self and acting self
- No big action, just awareness shifting

### Module 02 (Superposition):
- Multiple paths possible, none yet chosen
- Tension of holding contradictions
- Calendar conflicts, dual lives, both/and thinking

### Module 03 (Wave Function Collapse):
- The decision moment - one path chosen
- Not dramatic, often quiet certainty
- Show immediate consequences and relief/terror mix

### Module 04 (Quantum Eraser):
- Rewriting meaning of past events
- Not changing facts, changing interpretation
- Journal writing, therapy, conversation that shifts perspective

### Module 05 (Retrocausality):
- Future self/vision pulling character forward
- Visualization, goal-setting, reverse engineering life
- Decisions made from future identity not current fear

### Module 06 (Entanglement):
- Mentor, family, friend relationship defining character
- Learning to take influence without losing self
- Boundaries, connection, mutual impact

### Module 07 (Decoherence):
- External pressure to conform/fragment
- Character stays coherent under stress
- Often returns to challenging environment, stays whole

**Remember:** We're creating realistic, grounded transformation stories that happen to use quantum physics as metaphor. The physics is background—the human experience is foreground.

Write like you're telling a friend's real story, not crafting a parable.
